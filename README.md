# Sales-Performance-Decision-Making-Using-Statistics
## Overview

This analysis was conducted to understand how sales are performing, how reliable the insights are, and whether a new marketing strategy is improving revenue. To achieve this, statistical tests and summary measures were used to evaluate patterns in monthly revenue. The results help determine whether observed differences in revenue are meaningful and whether changes in marketing efforts have had an impact.

## Hypothesis Testing Results

To evaluate whether the marketing campaign increased revenue, the following hypotheses were applied:
- Null Hypothesis (H₀): Mean revenue (campaign) = Mean revenue (no campaign)
- Alternative Hypothesis (H₁): Mean revenue (campaign) > Mean revenue (no campaign)

### Results:

- Test Statistic: 4.34
- P-value: 0.0000162
- Effect Size (Cohens'd): 0.262
- Decision: Reject H₀

### Interpretation

- The very small p-value (0.0000162) indicates strong statistical evidence against the null hypothesis. This means we can confidently conclude that the mean revenue during the campaign period is higher than the mean revenue during the no-campaign period.

- The effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.262) suggests a small to moderate practical impact. While the increase in revenue is statistically significant, the actual magnitude of the effect is modest, meaning the campaign has a noticeable but not very large effect on revenue.

- Overall: The analysis shows that the marketing campaign has a positive impact on revenue, both statistically and practically, though the practical effect is moderate.

## Sales Performance Summary

### Measures of Central Tendency:
- Mean: 248,159
- Median: 250,309
- Mode: 105,775

### Measures of Dispersion:
- Range: 198,604
- Variance: 1,199,955,652
- Standard Deviation: 34,640

### Interpretation

- Sales are generally stable, with the mean and median being very close.
- The low mode indicates that some months perform much lower than others.
- The range and standard deviation show moderate fluctuations in revenue, which is normal in most businesses but still important to manage.
 
## Insights

### 1. How sales are performing

- Sales are not consistent across the year. Some months perform significantly better than others.
- Most months fall close to the average, showing stable performance with a few low months pulling the mode down.

### 2. How reliable the insights are

- Insights are highly reliable because the statistical test found significant results with a very small p-value.
- The effect size shows that the differences are meaningful in practice.
- The closeness of mean and median also reinforces that the data is not heavily skewed, improving reliability.

### 3. Whether a new marketing strategy is improving revenue

- Since revenue differences are statistically significant, this suggests that the marketing strategy may have contributed to changes in revenue.
- The moderate effect size indicates that the strategy is having a noticeable but not extreme impact.

## Recommendations

1.	Strengthen the marketing strategy during low-performing months - Use promotions, discounts, or targeted campaigns to raise sales where revenue drops to mode levels.
2.	Maximize peak months - High-performing months should be supported with adequate inventory, staffing, and marketing activities.
3.	Continue monitoring revenue monthly - Ongoing tracking will show whether the marketing strategy continues to improve sales over time.

## Conclusion

The significant difference in revenue suggests that the new marketing strategy may be contributing positively to performance, although continued monitoring is recommended. By using these insights to guide planning and strategy, the business can improve sales stability, efficiency, and long-term growth.
